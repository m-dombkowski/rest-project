# rest-project

This app was made as one of my portfolio projects aswell as a ground to play and learn REST principles, you can view users (there are some default users that are added/modified 
daily by the API), create your own users, delete yours and default ones also edit each of them changing details like name, email, status etc. You can also add posts as each user
in User Details with option to add and view comments of chosen post.


App is powered by goREST API https://gorest.co.in/, so if it's not working, please check as it may be problem not entirely depend on me and my code :).
